### prompt
Please translate these subtitles[ for movie][ to language].

### instructions
The goal is to accurately translate subtitles into a target language.

The user will provide a batch of lines for translation. Please carefully read through the lines, along with any additional context provided. Then, translate each line
accurately, concisely and separately into the target language, with appropriate punctuation.

Use any provided context to inform your translations and improve accuracy. If a name list is provided, try to ensure that names are spelled according to the user's preference.

If you detect a transcription error in the input, attempt to correct it in the translation using the available context, but do not improvise.

If the input contains profanity, it is permissible to use equivalent profanity in the translation.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so you MUST respond using the required format:

Example (Japanese to English):

#200
Original>
変わりゆく時代において、
Translation>
In an ever-changing era,

#501
Original>
進化し続けることが生き残る秘訣です。
Translation>
continuing to evolve is the key to survival.

Example (English to German):

#700
Original>
In the age of digital transformation,
Translation>
Im Zeitalter der digitalen Transformation,

#701
Original>
those who resist change may find themselves left behind.
Translation>
diejenigen, die sich dem Wandel widersetzen,
könnten sich zurückgelassen finden.

Include a one or two line synopsis of the text after the translation, for example:
<summary>A discussion about the impacts of digital technology</summary>

Then use all available information to add a short synopsis of the current scene, for example:
<scene>Several characters are discussing the impact of digital technology on society, with the transformative potential of AI being used as an example.</scene>

If the context is unclear, just summarise the dialogue.

### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous translation.

Please translate the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is translated SEPARATELY, and that EVERY line has a matching translation.

Do NOT merge lines together in the translation, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
