誰だ動かない方がいいよ.

7

なかなかいい部屋だろう.

その前にタバコ一本させろ.

22
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,970
それぐらいだろう.

23
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,170
遠慮するな.

24
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,550
近頃は肩着でも10持ってるんだよ.

25
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,010
余裕だな 売ってないと思ってるのか.

26
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,670
死体はここ俺の店だ.

27
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:40,490
従業員は何も見ないし 何も聞かないどうする.

28
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,370
殺しの報酬に お前の命の値段は入ってないだろう.

29
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,370
ありのままな証拠だ.

30
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,790
諦めてとっとと消えろ.

どうして俺を殺すんだ.

37
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,350
どうせ殺されるんだ.

38
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:54,890
教えてくれプロの美学か.

39
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,460
風が強いな明日晴れてくれるといいんだ.

40
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,700
明日は雨だよ.

41
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,100
天気予報が何でわかる.

42
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,970
せっかくの料理だ.

43
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,080
いくらで雇われた.

44
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
二倍出そう.

45
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,580
ここから出て行って.

46
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,580
お前はその依頼人を消してくれたら 販売だ.

47
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
親父にも黙っててよ.

48
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,540
4倍だそれで手を打って.

49
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,600
荷物を出すだけだ.

50
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
全部持ってけ明日金だ.

51
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,670
あんたを殺してそれをいただくこともできる.

52
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,030
お前そんなことやんないだろう.

53
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,480
そんなに命が惜しい.

54
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,780
惜しいねこんな仕事でも 25年もやってるとな.

55
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,340
金は欲しくないが命は惜しい.

56
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:47,760
お前どこの丸だ興味があるんだよ 殺し屋になるような人間ってのはどんなやつなのか
ましてお前みたいな格好した 殺し屋なんてのは珍しいからな.

57
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,980
どうせ死ぬんだ教えてくれてもいいだろう.

58
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:13,230
東京でその髪型なんてんだ.

59
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,250
完璧だろう.

60
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,690
辛い.

61
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,110
本物の中華でもこうなのか.

62
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,230

It's Hoshino, ordering the usual.
Hoshino, asking for the boss.

Everything is going well.

Leave it to me.

Who is it? You better not move.

7
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,930
It's a pretty nice room, isn't it?

8
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,650
It cost a lot of money.

9
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,060
Shall we start the meal?

10
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,390
If you want to eat here,

11
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,670
you'll have to make a
reservation for another day.

12
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,820
Is today the only day available?

13
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,410
I told you not to move.

14
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,890
It's a cell phone.

15
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,910
I'm on the shoulder.

16
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Why don't you sit down?

17
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,090
What do you want?

18
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,130
I'll give you anything you want.
Just say it.

Hurry up and tell me, what do you want?

Don't hold back.

24
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,550
These days, even the yakuza carry ten.

25
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,010
You're confident.
Do you think I won't shoot?

26
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,670
The body will be here, in my restaurant.

27
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:40,490
The staff won't see or hear anything.
What will you do?

28
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,370
Your life isn't included
in the reward for the kill.

29
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,370
It's undeniable evidence.

30
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,790
Give up and get lost.

31
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:29,100
Choose what to eat after the meal.

32
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:58,770
Or is it dinner now?

33
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:28,560
Tonight is a bento.

34
00:11:29,540 --> 00:13:40,620
Tonight is a bento, tonight is a bento.
If you can do it, go ahead.

35
00:13:46,840 --> 00:15:31,500
Who asked you tonight?

36
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,790
Why are you going to kill me?

37
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,350
I'm going to be killed anyway.

38
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:54,890
Tell me, is it the professional's code?

39
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,460
The wind is strong.
I hope it clears up tomorrow.

40
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,700
It will rain tomorrow.

41
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,100
How do you know the weather forecast?

42
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,970
It's a special meal.

43
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,080
How much were you hired for?

44
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
I'll pay you double.

45
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,580
Get out of here.

46
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,580
If you take out your client, it's a deal.

47
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
Don't tell my old man.

48
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,540
Four times the amount, take it or leave it.

49
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,600
Just take out the goods.

50
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Take everything.
The money will be there tomorrow.

51
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,670
I could kill you and take it myself.

52
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,030
You wouldn't do that.

53
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,480
Is your life that precious?

54
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,780
Yes, it is.
Even in this line of work, after 25 years.

55
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,340
I don't want the money,
but I do value my life.

56
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:41,287
I'm curious, where are you from?
What kind of person becomes an assassin?

57
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:47,760
Especially an assassin dressed like you,
that's quite rare.

58
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,980
Since you're going to die anyway,
you might as well tell me.

59
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:13,230
What's that hairstyle called in Tokyo?

60
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,250
It's perfect, right?

61
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,690
Spicy.

62
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,110
Is it like this even with
authentic Chinese food?

63
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,230
What's with the order of the dishes?
